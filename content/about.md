Who am I? What is my purpose in life? Why am I here? Is the world inherently meaningless? Is it simply down to the individual to create their own sense of meaning and purpose? I think I can answer at least one of those questions. Will this page be out of date in a few months? Probably. Will I update it? Probably not. Will I lose sleep over an outdated About Me page? Remains to be seen, safe bet is no.
